This is a Maven project implementing an ImageJ plugin which helps to download and to install 
components of javacv package (java interface to OpenCV, FFmpeg and others) by Samuel Audet.
Other ImageJ plugins which require javacv may use it to check if necessary libraries are 
installed and to install missing components.
